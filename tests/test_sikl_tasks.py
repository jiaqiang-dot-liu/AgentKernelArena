"""Invariants for the SIKL rewrite tasks.

Each task reimplements one workload-schema operator in FlyDSL and is scored
against that operator's production implementation over every case the schema
declares. The task carries the schema's unfilled ``kernel-forges`` solution slot
so post-processing can fill it from the scored result.

The checks here pin the couplings that fail silently rather than loudly: a
factory symbol the harness looks up but the pipeline never asks for, a gate
derived from a number nobody measured, or a driver that times the candidate
differently from the way the task is scored.
