"""Every backend a task declares must be one KernelForge actually serves.

The companion to `test_cheatsheet_language_coverage.py`, guarding the same class
of failure one layer down. There, an unregistered `repository_language` made the
agent never start and the run report a speedup of exactly 1.0. Here, a backend
KernelForge does not register does not stop anything: upstream maps the unknown
name onto flydsl and says nothing, so the run starts, finishes, and reports a
plausible number reached under the wrong expertise prompt. Nothing in the logs
connects the two, which is worse than the crash.

`_resolve_kernel_backend` refuses such a name at launch. These tests make sure
the task tree stays inside what it will accept, so a task added with a backend
nobody serves is a red test rather than a wasted GPU-day.
