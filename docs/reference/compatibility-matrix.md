# AgentKernelArena compatibility matrix

## Hardware requirements

The following hardware configurations are supported and tested.

| GPU | ROCm version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AMD Instinct™ MI300 series  | 7.2 (Bundled in the selected SGLang image.) | `target_gpu_model: MI300` |
| AMD Instinct™ MI355X | 7.2 (Bundled in the selected SGLang image.) | `target_gpu_model: MI355X` |

## Software requirements

The following software versions are required or verified.

| Component | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hipcc | Matches image ROCm | Required for HIP tasks. |
| rocprof-compute | Matches image ROCm | Required for HIP performance profiling. |
| Docker | Current stable release | Required; serial experiments run through `make docker-run`; multi-GPU experiments run through `make docker-parallel-run`. |
| SGLang runtime image | `lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.12-rocm720-mi30x` for `gfx942`; `lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.14-rocm720-mi35x-20260705` for `gfx950` | The verified `gfx950` digest is `sha256:b435b508b5aa696abb25c909341ce73e41574c4271cf716bed72418dcea86b78`. Override with `AKA_DOCKER_IMAGE`, `AKA_DOCKER_IMAGE_GFX942`, or `AKA_DOCKER_IMAGE_GFX950`. |
| Python | Provided by the image (for example, 3.10) | Bundled in the SGLang image. |
| Node.js and npm | Node.js 22 with a current npm | Required on the host only for the alternative npm installation of Claude Code or another npm-installed agent CLI. |
| PyTorch | ROCm build bundled in the image | Provided by the SGLang Docker image. |
| Triton | Bundled with the image's ROCm PyTorch | Required for Triton task categories. |
| AITER | `0.1.17.dev110+g9127c94a1` in the verified `gfx950` image | Required by AITER-backed task oracles and kernels. |
| FlyDSL | `0.2.2` in the verified `gfx950` image (or `make docker-setup-flydsl` when absent) | Required for `flydsl2flydsl`, `torch2flydsl`, and `triton2flydsl` tasks. |

## Agents

The following templates are selectable in the current `AgentType` registry. See
[Install AgentKernelArena](../install/install.md) and
[Configure agents and models](../how-to/agents.md) for setup instructions.

| Template | Runtime dependency |
| --- | --- |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent CLI and host login state. |
| `claude_code` | Native/local or npm-installed Claude Code CLI and host login state. |
| `codex` | Codex CLI and host login state. |
| `geak_v3` | GEAK CLI; HIP-oriented integration. |
| `geak_v3_triton` | GEAK CLI; Triton-oriented integration. |
| `mini_swe_triton` | mini-swe-agent/GEAK dependencies. |
| `task_validator` | Claude Code or Codex backend configured in `agents/task_validator/agent_config.yaml`. |

## Model providers

Model/provider support is integration-specific; run configuration files do not
configure a provider.

| Provider | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI | Use a selected integration or CLI configured for OpenAI. |
| Anthropic | Use a selected integration or CLI configured for Anthropic. |
| OpenRouter or another OpenAI-compatible service | Supported when the selected integration accepts a custom provider/base URL. |
| Local vLLM | `make vllm` starts an OpenAI-compatible endpoint on port `30001`; configure the selected integration to use it. |
