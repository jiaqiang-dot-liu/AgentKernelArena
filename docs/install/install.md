# Install AgentKernelArena

AgentKernelArena runs controlled agent experiments against GPU kernel tasks on
an AMD GPU. Docker is the supported workflow: each experiment runs inside the
GPU-architecture-specific SGLang image and bind-mounts the required local agent
CLI plus its login state.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required before running AgentKernelArena.

- **Linux host with a supported AMDGPU kernel driver:** `/dev/kfd` and
  `/dev/dri` must be present. The runner also mounts `/dev/mem` when present.
- **Docker Engine:** the current user must be able to access the Docker daemon
  without `sudo`.
- **SGLang runtime image:** `gfx942` uses
  `lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.12-rocm720-mi30x`; `gfx950` uses
  `lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.14-rocm720-mi35x-20260705`. The runner selects from
  `target_gpu_model` for experiment runs and from the visible host GPU for shell
  and smoke commands.
- **Git**
- **Node.js 22+ and npm**, when using the alternative npm installation of Claude
  Code or another npm-installed agent CLI.
- The selected agent CLI installed and authenticated on the host. The Docker
  runner provisions only the configured agent for a normal run. Codex, Claude
  Code, and Cursor Agent are the first-class host-CLI integrations. See
  [Configure agents and models](../how-to/agents.md).

## Docker runner

From the repository root, use the Docker-first Makefile targets. The runner does
not copy credentials into an image; it bind-mounts the existing host login state.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMD-AGI/AgentKernelArena.git
cd AgentKernelArena

# Verify the container runtime and GPU.
make docker-smoke
```

Start an interactive shell in the same environment:

```bash
make docker-shell
```

Install and authenticate the agent selected by your configuration before
starting an experiment; the next section covers the first-class host CLIs.

## Install agent CLIs

Install whichever agent you plan to run. Claude Code recommends its native
installer; npm is also supported by the Docker runner:

```bash
# Recommended native installation on Linux/macOS/WSL:
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude --version

# Alternative npm installation (requires Node.js 22+):
# node --version
# npm --version
# npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Authenticate on the host after either installation, then exit Claude Code.
claude
claude auth status

# Alternatively, install Cursor Agent:
# make install-cursor-agent

# For Codex, follow its official CLI instructions and ensure `codex` is on PATH.
```

Installing an agent CLI is not enough: authenticate it on the host before an
agent check or experiment. The Docker runner supports both Claude Code's native
installation and its alternative npm installation. See the
[official Claude Code setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation)
for current installation alternatives.

The `geak_v3`, `geak_v3_triton`, and `mini_swe_triton` integrations require
their own runtime dependencies. Review the corresponding directory under
`agents/` before selecting one.

## Choose an example configuration

Choose the configuration that matches the physical GPU and installed agent.
The two quickstart configurations each run one GELU task; the benchmark
configuration is a longer 60-task Cursor Agent run.

| Configuration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi300.yaml` | First Claude Code run on MI300/MI300X (`gfx942`). |
| `example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi355x.yaml` | First Claude Code run on MI355X (`gfx950`). |
| `example_configs/benchmark_cursor_mi355x.yaml` | Curated 60-task Cursor Agent benchmark on MI355X; requires an installed and authenticated Cursor Agent CLI. |

The default `make docker-run` configuration is the MI300/MI300X quickstart.
On another GPU, always pass the matching `CONFIG`; for MI355X, use
`example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi355x.yaml`.

Select one quickstart configuration in the current shell:

```bash
# MI300/MI300X:
CONFIG_PATH=example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi300.yaml

# For MI355X instead:
# CONFIG_PATH=example_configs/quickstart_claude_mi355x.yaml
```

Verify the agent selected by that configuration, then run the single task:

```bash
make docker-check-agents CONFIG="$CONFIG_PATH"
make docker-run CONFIG="$CONFIG_PATH"
```

To create another experiment, copy the nearest example and edit the copy rather
than changing a shared example in place:

```bash
cp "$CONFIG_PATH" my_experiment.yaml
```

## FlyDSL tasks (optional)

`flydsl2flydsl`, `torch2flydsl`, and `triton2flydsl` tasks need the `flydsl`
package inside the container. The selected image may already ship it
(`make docker-smoke` prints `flydsl=ok <version>` when present). If yours does
not, install it once into the container's persistent pip user-base:

```bash
make docker-setup-flydsl
```

This is a no-op when the image already provides FlyDSL.

## Configure authentication and providers

Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex reuse their host CLI authentication. A normal run
preflights only its selected CLI. For another config that selects one of these
CLIs—or `task_validator`, which resolves to its configured backend—check the
same CLI without starting a task by passing that run config:

```bash
make docker-check-agents CONFIG=my_experiment.yaml

# Optional overrides:
make docker-check-agents AGENTS=claude_code,codex
make docker-check-agents AGENTS=all
```

`AGENTS=all` is the explicit strict check for Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex.
Specialized integrations such as GEAK and mini-swe use their own dependency and
authentication checks. They read credentials and provider endpoints from their
own environment/configuration; there is no shared provider field in the root
run configuration.

To run against a self-hosted model instead of a hosted provider, start a local
vLLM server:

```bash
make vllm
```

This launches a `rocm/vllm` container with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint on port
`30001`. Starting the server does not automatically configure an agent; point
the selected integration at the endpoint using that integration's base-URL and
provider settings.

## Verify the installation

The quickstart run above confirms that the framework, GPU, and agent CLI work
together. It creates a timestamped workspace directory
(`workspace_<gpu>_<agent>/run_<timestamp>/`), logs to `logs/`, and writes a
`task_result.yaml` for the task.

To run across multiple GPUs, list host GPU IDs or omit `GPU_IDS` to discover
them with `rocm-smi --showid`:

```bash
make docker-parallel-run CONFIG="$CONFIG_PATH" GPU_IDS=0,1,2,3
```

See [Run an experiment](../how-to/run-evaluation.md) for the full workflow.
