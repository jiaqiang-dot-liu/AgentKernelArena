# AgentKernelArena documentation

This directory contains the source for the AgentKernelArena documentation site.
It follows the same structure as other ROCm toolkit component docs and is built
with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and
[rocm-docs-core](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-docs-core). Both Markdown (MyST,
`.md`) and reStructuredText (`.rst`) sources are supported and can be mixed.

## Building locally

```bash
# From the repository root
python3 -m venv .docvenv
source .docvenv/bin/activate
pip install -r docs/sphinx/requirements.txt

python -m sphinx -T -b html docs docs/_build/html
# Open docs/_build/html/index.html
```

| `sphinx/requirements.txt` | Pinned documentation dependencies used by the build. |

## Notes on the local build

A local build outside AMD infrastructure prints benign warnings for intersphinx
inventory fetches and a `Current project 'AgentKernelArena' not found in
projects` message until the project is registered in the rocm-docs-core project
registry. The build itself succeeds.
