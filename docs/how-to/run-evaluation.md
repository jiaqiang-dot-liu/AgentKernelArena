# Run an experiment in AgentKernelArena

An experiment runs one agent configuration against a task set and produces
structured outcome and score signals. Repeat the run with one controlled change
to create an A/B comparison. This topic explains how to configure, execute,
resume, and inspect a run.

## Configure `config.yaml`

The root `config.yaml` selects the agent, the tasks, and the target GPU. The
example below uses Cursor Agent, so install and authenticate Cursor first, or
change `agent.template` to a host CLI you have already installed and logged in:

```yaml
agent:
  template: cursor          # one agent template per run

tasks:
  - hip2hip/gpumode/GELU
  - triton2triton/vllm/triton_rms_norm
  # - hip2hip                 # all tasks under a category
  # - all                     # every available task

target_gpu_model: MI300
log_directory: logs
workspace_directory_prefix: workspace
```

### Select tasks

Each entry in `tasks` is a path relative to the `tasks/` directory. You can
select tasks at any level of granularity.

| Entry | Selects |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | Every task in `tasks/` |
| `hip2hip` | All tasks under `tasks/hip2hip/` |
| `triton2triton/vllm` | All tasks under that subdirectory |
| `hip2hip/gpumode/GELU` | A single task |

See [Configuration and API reference](../reference/api-reference.md) for the full
set of `config.yaml` fields.

## Start a run

```bash
make docker-run CONFIG=config.yaml
```

Use a non-default config file to keep multiple task sets side-by-side:

```bash
make docker-run CONFIG=config_triton.yaml
```

Add a suffix to label a run directory (useful for A/B testing):

```bash
make docker-run CONFIG=config.yaml RUN_ARGS="--run-suffix cursor_with_mcp"
# → workspace_MI300_cursor/run_20260617_101500_cursor_with_mcp
```

For debugging, enter the same Docker runtime used by the experiment:

```bash
make docker-shell
```

The Docker runner currently supports Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor Agent login
reuse from the host. It preflights the selected config before starting the run.

## Run across multiple GPUs

Use `make docker-parallel-run` when a server has multiple GPUs and the task set
is large enough to keep them busy. The parallel runner starts one Docker worker
container per GPU, masks each worker to one GPU, and lets workers claim tasks
from a shared queue:

```bash
make docker-parallel-run CONFIG=config.yaml GPU_IDS=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
```

If `GPU_IDS` is omitted, the runner discovers GPU IDs with `rocm-smi --showid`:

```bash
make docker-parallel-run CONFIG=config.yaml
```

`RUN_ARGS` works the same way as `docker-run`:

```bash
make docker-parallel-run \
  CONFIG=config.yaml \
  GPU_IDS=0,1 \
  RUN_ARGS="--run-suffix parallel_smoke"
```

The Docker parallel path is verified for `cursor`, `claude_code`, `codex`, and
`task_validator`. Specialized GEAK/mini-swe templates require their own
dependencies and worker-visible GPU configuration. See
[Run tasks in parallel across multiple GPUs](parallel-run.md) for scheduling,
GPU isolation, resume behavior, and failure handling.

## What happens during a run

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Load config.yaml] --> B[Register agent launcher]
    B --> C[Discover tasks]
    C --> D[Create timestamped workspace per task]
    D --> E[Measure baseline performance]
    E --> F[Launch agent in workspace]
    F --> G[Evaluate: compile, correctness, performance]
    G --> H[Write task_result.yaml + score]
    H --> I[Post-processing: aggregate report]
```

For each task, the framework:

1. Copies the task into an isolated, timestamped workspace.
2. Measures a *baseline* (compiles and times the original kernel; for
   `torch2hip` tasks it times the PyTorch reference directly).
3. Launches the configured agent with a generated prompt.
4. Evaluates the agent's kernel for compilation, correctness, and performance.
5. Writes a standardized `task_result.yaml` and computes a score.

After all tasks finish, a post-processing step aggregates the per-task results
into a run report.

`task_validator` uses a separate path: it skips baseline measurement and kernel
scoring, writes `validation_report.yaml` per task, and aggregates a
`validation_summary.yaml`.

Run the same configuration again with one agent capability changed and a new
`--run-suffix` to form a controlled A/B pair. See
[Configure agents and models](agents.md#ab-testing-and-ablation-studies).

## Resume an interrupted run

Long runs can be resumed; completed tasks are skipped.

```bash
# Resume a specific run directory
make docker-run CONFIG=config.yaml RUN_ARGS="--resume-run run_20260617_101500"

# Resume the most recent run
make docker-run CONFIG=config.yaml RUN_ARGS="--resume-latest"
```

For a parallel run, use the same `RUN_ARGS` with `docker-parallel-run`:

```bash
make docker-parallel-run CONFIG=config.yaml GPU_IDS=0,1,2,3 RUN_ARGS="--resume-latest"
```

## Read the results

A run produces this layout under the workspace directory:

```text
workspace_<gpu>_<agent>/
└── run_<timestamp>/
    ├── .parallel/              # present for docker-parallel-run
    │   ├── pending/
    │   ├── running/
    │   ├── done/
    │   └── failed/
    ├── <task_name>_<timestamp>/
    │   ├── task_result.yaml      # per-task outcome + reward/score
    │   └── ...                   # modified source and task artifacts
    └── reports/
        ├── overall_summary.csv
        ├── task_type_breakdown.json
        └── overall_report.txt
```

Each `task_result.yaml` contains the scored outcome:

```yaml
task_name: hip2hip/gpumode/GELU
pass_compilation: true
pass_correctness: true
base_execution_time: 1.82        # ms
best_optimized_execution_time: 1.15
speedup_ratio: 1.58
optimization_summary: "..."
score: 278.0
```

The `score` combines compilation, correctness, and speedup and can be consumed
as a reward by an external policy-search or RL system. See
[Configuration and API reference](../reference/api-reference.md#scoring) for the
scoring formula, and [Visualize and compare runs](visualization.md) to render and
compare reports across agents.
