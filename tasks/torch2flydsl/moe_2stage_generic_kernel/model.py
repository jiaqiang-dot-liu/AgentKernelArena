"""Pure-PyTorch reference for the generic two-stage fused MoE (``ck_moe`` /
``moe_stage1_g1u1``).

The op is a top-k Mixture-of-Experts feed-forward block evaluated as a grouped
two-stage GEMM in bf16, matching the AMD runtime generic CK MoE path
(``aiter.fused_moe`` with ``QuantType.No``):

- a softmax router selects ``topk`` experts per token and renormalizes the
  weights;
- stage 1 runs the grouped gate/up GEMM (``w1``) followed by ``silu(gate) * up``;
- the stage-1 intermediate is truncated to bf16 (the operand the stage-2 GEMM
  consumes);
- stage 2 runs the grouped down GEMM (``w2``) and combines the experts with the
  renormalized router weights.

Each GEMM accumulates in fp32 over bf16 operands and the final output is bf16,
mirroring the upstream (b)-faithful reference
``aiter.fused_moe.torch_moe_stage1`` / ``torch_moe_stage2`` (no quantization).
