"""Dual-path measurement driver for the a16w16 GEMM rewrite task.

THE OPERATOR
    A 16-bit GEMM with a transposed weight: ``out = a @ b.T``. The constant axes
    (n, k), the list of scored m cases and the seed live in the task's
    workload.json; scripts/task_inputs.py is the single place that reads them,
    and both this driver and the Arena harness build their inputs through it.

THE BASELINE IMPLEMENTATION TO REPLACE (read it, it is the real thing)
    entry    aiter_source/aiter/tuned_gemm.py:354  gemm_a16w16

    `gemm_a16w16` is a tuned DISPATCH, not one kernel. It looks the shape up in
    aiter's merged bf16 tuned table (configs/bf16_tuned_gemm.csv merged with
    configs/model_configs/*_bf16_tuned_gemm.csv) and selects a libtype per M
    bucket. One libtype is `flydsl` -- aiter's own FlyDSL kernels under
    aiter/ops/flydsl/kernels/splitk_hgemm.py and small_m_hgemm.py, built through
    aiter/ops/flydsl/kernels/hgemm_dispatch.py -- and the other is `torch`
    (native matmul, i.e. hipBLASLt).

    The selection is NOT monotonic in M, so do not assume a small-M / large-M
    split: on gfx950/256CU at n=k=6144 it picks `flydsl` at m=1..128 and again at
    m=512, and `torch` at m=256, 1024, 2048 and 4096. Which one a given case
    faces is not recorded anywhere in the task: query it with
    `aiter.tuned_gemm.get_GEMM_A16W16_config(M=.., N=.., K=.., bias=False,
    dtype="torch.bfloat16", otype="torch.bfloat16")`, which is the same lookup
    the baseline performs.

CORRECTNESS GATE
    scripts/task_compare.py, which is the workload schema's own comparison
    callback, copied from the bundle without edit. It owns the tolerance and the
    task does not set, scale or relax it -- the acceptance run that verifies a
    submitted result applies the same file, so a candidate this driver keeps is
    a candidate that run accepts.

    scripts/task_initialize.py is the bundle's input callback on the same terms:
    `a` and `b` are both standard normal. Inputs are built one case at a time
    because the bundle initializes one workload point at a time.

    The distribution is worth knowing when you choose an accumulator. At this
    scale the output runs to a standard deviation in the tens, so the
    comparison's absolute term stops mattering and its relative term governs:
    truncating split-k or K-warp partial sums to bf16 puts roughly a tenth of
    the output out of tolerance. Reduce in fp32.

    The production implementation is judged by the same callback beside every
    case and the result is printed, but it does not move the bar: it does not
    clear it at every shape.

THE INTERFACE THE PORT MUST EXPOSE
    The FlyDSL candidate module must define the builder symbol named by
    KERNELFORGE_REWRITE_BUILDER_SYMBOL:

        build_<slug>_module(m, n, k) -> launch

        launch(a, b) -> out

    Called with keyword arguments (``m=``, ``n=``, ``k=``). The builder is
    called ONCE PER CASE and the returned launch is what gets timed, so build
    all shape-dependent work -- FlyDSL compilation, tile and split-k selection,
    any scratch allocation -- inside the builder. `m` is passed because the
    tuned table picks a different kernel per M bucket; aiter's own FlyDSL
    factories compile on (dtype, n, k) plus a tile config and take M as a
    runtime grid dimension, so `m` is a selection input rather than a
    specialization one.

    Tensor layouts are exactly what the operator receives (see task_inputs.py):
        a      [m, k]  bfloat16
        b      [n, k]  bfloat16      (trans_b: the product is a @ b.T)
        out    [m, n]  bfloat16      (returned, not written into an argument)

WHAT THE CORRECTNESS SUITE CHECKS BEFORE SCORING
    The product has to come out of kernels the candidate itself writes in
    FlyDSL. Two ways of not doing that are checked mechanically, so they cost an
    attempt rather than producing a score:

    Importing aiter -- including its FlyDSL kernel modules under
    aiter/ops/flydsl/kernels/ -- launches the implementation this task exists to
    replace.

    Computing the product with torch (`@`, torch.matmul / mm / bmm / einsum /
    addmm / F.linear) resolves to hipBLASLt, which IS the baseline at the larger
    M cases, so it would tie the baseline while implementing no kernel at all.
    Torch is otherwise free to use for tensor plumbing.

    Beyond that the implementation is open: any FlyDSL structure, tiling,
    pipelining or per-shape dispatch you can make fast is fair game.

MODES
    (no flag)          correctness: candidate vs task_reference over every case,
                       prints one `allclose:` verdict and no `SNR:` line (see
                       run_correctness for why)
    --ref-bench-mode   times the baseline (task_baseline = aiter.tuned_gemm)
    --bench-mode       times the FlyDSL candidate
    --profile-run      builds and warms the candidate, prints no timing

Both bench modes print one `case_ms:` line per case plus a `mean_ms:` aggregate,
and both time through scripts/task_measure.py -- the same module the Arena
harness scores with, so the number this driver reports and the number the task
is scored on come from one implementation rather than two that agree today.
`--warmup` and `--iters` are accepted for contract compatibility but do not
change the protocol: a candidate is only worth keeping if it holds up under the
protocol that decides the score, and honouring a smaller count would report a
number that cannot be compared against it.

Timing the operator eagerly instead would let per-call host dispatch dominate the
tens of microseconds of device work at the small-M cases, so a candidate that
merely pre-builds for a fixed shape would report a large speedup while running
identical kernels -- and the win would not exist in a graph-captured server.
