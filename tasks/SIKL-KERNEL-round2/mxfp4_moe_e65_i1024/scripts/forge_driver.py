"""Dual-path measurement driver for the MXFP4 fused-MoE rewrite task.

THE OPERATOR
    A routed-expert MoE layer, one layer, MXFP4 group_size 32
    (QuantType.per_1x32), SiLU, bf16 in and out. Both operands are MXFP4
    (afp4_wfp4): the weights arrive pre-quantized and preshuffled, the
    activation is quantized on the fly, once into stage 1 and again on the
    stage-1 output into stage 2. The axes, the list of scored cases, the seed
    and the gate policy live in the task's workload.json; scripts/task_inputs.py
    is the single place that reads them, and both this driver and the Arena
    harness build their inputs through it.

    fused_moe is a tuned DISPATCH, not one kernel: it selects a stage-1 and a
    stage-2 kernel per M bucket out of aiter/configs/model_configs. Which pair a
    given case faces is not recorded anywhere in the task -- set
    AITER_LOG_TUNED_CONFIG to have aiter report the resolved kernel names.

CORRECTNESS GATE
    Derived, not fixed. This driver measures the production implementation's own
    distance to the reference at every case and admits a candidate within
    `gate_multiplier` (workload.json) times the worst of those. So the bar is
    "no worse than what ships", evaluated on the machine you are running on.
    That distance is not uniform across the cases: the tuned stage-1 variants
    that fuse the output quantization into their epilogue sit an order of
    magnitude further from the reference than the others.

THE INTERFACE THE PORT MUST EXPOSE
    The FlyDSL candidate module must define the builder symbol named by
    KERNELFORGE_REWRITE_BUILDER_SYMBOL:

        build_<slug>_module(num_tokens, model_dim, inter_dim, num_experts, topk)
            -> launch

        launch(hidden_states, w1, w2, topk_weight, topk_ids,
               w1_scale, w2_scale, activation, doweight_stage1)
            -> out

    The builder is called with keyword arguments, ONCE PER CASE, and the
    returned launch is what gets timed, so build all shape-dependent work --
    FlyDSL compilation, tile and split-k selection, any scratch allocation --
    inside the builder.

    Tensor layouts are exactly what the operator receives (see task_inputs.py),
    with E experts, D model_dim and I inter_dim:
        hidden_states   [num_tokens, D]     bfloat16
        w1              [E, 2*I, D/2]       float4_e2m1fn_x2  (preshuffled)
        w1_scale        [E, 2*I, D/32]      float8_e8m0fnu    (preshuffled)
        w2              [E, D, I/2]         float4_e2m1fn_x2  (preshuffled)
        w2_scale        [E, D, I/32]        float8_e8m0fnu    (preshuffled)
        topk_weight     [num_tokens, topk]  float32
        topk_ids        [num_tokens, topk]  int32
        activation      int   (0 = SiLU)
        doweight_stage1 bool  (False: routing weights applied in the stage-2 reduction)
        out             [num_tokens, D]     bfloat16  (returned, not written into an argument)

    w1 holds [gate | up] along its rows, which is what shuffle_weight((16, 16))
    implies together with doweight_stage1=False.

WHAT THE CORRECTNESS SUITE CHECKS BEFORE SCORING
    The layer has to come out of kernels the candidate itself writes in FlyDSL.
    Importing aiter -- including its FlyDSL kernel modules under
    aiter/ops/flydsl/kernels/ -- launches the implementation this task exists to
    replace, so the port would measure the baseline against itself; that is
    checked mechanically and costs an attempt rather than producing a score. The
    same goes for handing the computation to torch or another GPU library, which
    is otherwise free to use for tensor plumbing.

    Beyond that the implementation is open: how you stage, fuse, quantize and
    dispatch the layer in FlyDSL is your call.

MODES
    (no flag)          correctness: candidate vs task_reference over every case,
                       prints one `SNR: <db> dB` (the worst case) and one
                       `allclose:` verdict
    --ref-bench-mode   times the baseline (task_baseline = aiter.fused_moe)
    --bench-mode       times the FlyDSL candidate
    --profile-run      builds and warms the candidate, prints no timing

Both bench modes print one `case_ms:` line per case plus a `mean_ms:` aggregate,
and both time through scripts/task_measure.py -- the same module the Arena
harness scores with, so the number this driver reports and the number the task
is scored on come from one implementation rather than two that agree today.
`--warmup` and `--iters` are accepted for contract compatibility but do not
change the protocol: a candidate is only worth keeping if it holds up under the
protocol that decides the score, and honouring a smaller count would report a
number that cannot be compared against it.

Timing the operator eagerly instead would let per-call host dispatch dominate
the device work at the small-token cases, so a candidate that merely pre-builds
for a fixed shape would report a large speedup while running identical kernels
-- and the win would not exist in a graph-captured server.
