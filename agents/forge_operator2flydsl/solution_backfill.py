"""Fill a SIKL solution document from a scored rewrite task workspace.

A rewrite task carries the workload schema's unfilled ``kernel-forges`` solution
slot as ``solution.json``. After Arena has scored the task this module fills the
slot's empty fields from the run and writes the result into the task workspace,
next to ``task_result.yaml``.

It runs in post-processing rather than in the agent launcher because the
launcher returns before ``evaluate_kernel``: at that point the only evidence
available is KernelForge's own port verdict, which is what the loop uses to
decide KEEP/REVERT and explicitly not what the task is scored on. Everything
recorded here comes from Arena's own centralized evaluation.

The filled document is a run artifact, not a publication: syncing it into the
workload-schema bundle is a separate, deliberate step. Writing into another
repository from inside the evaluation loop would put a side effect outside the
run directory, race between the per-GPU workers of a parallel run, and let a
re-run silently overwrite a previously published solution.
