"""operator2flydsl via KernelForge's `kernel-agents forge-rewrite-by-flydsl`.

This is one provider of the ``operator2flydsl`` task type, not the definition of
it: the task says which operator to reimplement in FlyDSL and where it is scored,
and this agent adapts that to KernelForge's CLI. A different provider would read
the same task and never mention a port attempt or a rewrite pipeline.

That pipeline reimplements an operator in FlyDSL from its existing
implementation (PORT, correctness only) and then optimizes the port with a
nested forge-loop. This launcher adapts an Arena task to it:

  1. Build a scratch workspace beside the task as its own git repository with
     one commit. KernelForge's agent sessions require a git worktree with a
     resolvable HEAD, and it must be the scratch directory's own repository so
     that the framework base commit -- and therefore any apply-back patch -- is
     never computed against the Arena task's files.

     An Arena task has no framework repository to patch, so KernelForge reports
     ``applyback_required: true`` and ``success: false`` for an otherwise good
     port. This launcher therefore gates on ``port_ok``, and reserves nothing:
     the pipeline itself keeps its last 20 minutes for the apply-back stage.
  2. Copy the port source (the baseline implementation's entry file) and the
     task's dual-path driver into it. The PORT prompt reports the source by
     basename only, so it has to be reachable from the rewrite workspace.
  3. Shell out to the rewrite CLI (streaming output).
  4. Copy the ported FlyDSL kernel back onto the task's single declared editable
     source so Arena's own compile/correctness/performance commands score it.

Everything it reads from the task is a structured field, and all but one of them
already existed: ``source_file_path[0]`` is where the port lands,
``kernel_identity`` carries the operator's identity and its owning framework,
and ``rewrite_source_file`` -- the one field this task type adds -- names the
production implementation to port from. The source's host entry point is not a
field: KernelForge treats it as a prompt hint and does not fail without one, so
the task documents it in its instructions and in the driver docstring. How the campaign searches (attempt
count, coarse filter, budget, model) is agent configuration and is never read
from a task. See tasks/SIKL-task/gemm_a16w16_nt_n6144_k6144/config.yaml.

    Every search control comes from the agent config, never from the task. How

    filter sits describe how this agent searches, not what the operator computes
    or how Arena scores it; another agent implementing operator2flydsl may have
    no notion of either.

    No ``--rewrite-kb`` / ``--no-rewrite-kb`` is passed, on purpose. Whether the
    recipe store is reachable is a property of the environment rather than of
    the task or the agent, and KernelForge already resolves it from
    KNOWLEDGE_STORE_MODE and the KB_STORE credentials: unset means a local
    store that needs no credentials, ``remote`` means a remote one and names the
    missing variable if it is not configured. Forwarding a flag from Arena's own
    config could only override that with a worse-informed answer -- as it did
    while it defaulted the store off in environments that had it available.

    No ``--source-language`` either: KernelForge infers it from the source file,
    and this launcher has no better information. Guessing it from the suffix
    would be worse than silence, since these tasks port from a Python dispatch
    rather than from a Triton kernel.

    ``--framework`` carries the task's declared source owner, and it is not
    optional here even though KernelForge can infer one. Inference reads the
    framework out of the source file's path, and by this point the source is a
    copy inside the scratch workspace: the ``aiter`` component of
    ``/sgl-workspace/aiter/aiter/tuned_gemm.py`` is gone, so inference would
    fall back to ``unknown`` and file every recipe these tasks produce under an
    owner nothing looks for. It does not request apply-back -- that is decided
    by whether the workspace has a resolvable HEAD, not by this flag.

    No ``--source-entry`` or ``--target-functions``. The entry is a hint shown
    to the port agent; KernelForge says so and does not fail when it is absent,
    because the driver owns how the reference and the baseline are invoked. The
    task documents it in its instructions and in the driver docstring, which is
    where prose belongs. Dropping ``--target-functions`` with it is only safe
    because ``--framework`` is set above: it feeds the same owner inference.
