### Task Contract (Generic)

These constraints apply to every hip2hip task and must be honored regardless
of optimization strategy. Violating them will cause the task runner to fail
even when your kernel is otherwise correct and faster.

1. **Preserve kernel function names and signatures.**
   {names_intro}
{names_block}
   Do not rename them, drop parameters, reorder parameters, change parameter
   types, or change the return type. The task runner looks them up by exact
   name and calls them with the exact original signature.

2. **Keep the launch / configuration interface compatible.**
   Grid / block dimensions, stream usage, and any host-side launch helpers
   (wrapper functions, Python bindings, `extern "C"` shims) must remain
   call-compatible with the original. Do not change the number or order of
   launch parameters exposed to the host code that the task runner invokes.

3. **Output must remain directly compilable and runnable with the same
   interface.** The task's `compile_command`, `correctness_command`, and
   `performance_command` must succeed against your modified source without
   any external code changes (no edits to the test runner, no extra build
   flags). If you add new files, they must be picked up by the existing
   build invocation.

4. **Handle shared-memory launch sizing correctly if shared memory is
   introduced.** If your optimization introduces or grows `__shared__` /
   dynamic LDS allocations, you are responsible for passing the correct
   per-block shared-memory size at launch (`<<<grid, block, shmem_bytes,
   stream>>>` or the equivalent `hipLaunchKernelGGL` argument). Static
   shared memory must fit within the per-block LDS limit of the target
   architecture.
