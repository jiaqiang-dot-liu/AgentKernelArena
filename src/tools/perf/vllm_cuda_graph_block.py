    Timing and correctness are otherwise separate invocations, so a kernel can
    tell them apart and do less work in the one that is scored. Passing this
    collector to the benchmark makes the scored invocation itself observable:
    ``outputs`` aliases the buffers the timed unit last wrote, and ``rerun``
    executes that same unit again.

    Under CUDA-graph timing the buffers are captured once and every replay
    writes to those same addresses, so ``outputs`` keeps tracking replays. Under
    event-timing fallback the measured outputs cannot be observed reliably, so a
    benchmark that requests this collector fails closed instead of validating a
    separate post-timing invocation.
